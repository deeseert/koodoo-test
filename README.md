# koodoo-test

Very fun and interesting exercise where I had the chance to practise a bit of algorithm and testing, among other things.

Additional aspects I would have considered and not included in the task are:

- If there are negative values;
- if values are not numbers;
- if there are repetitions.

There are plenty of considerations one can do. However, I tried to consider the most obvious ones without risking to over-engineer the solution. Of course, depending on the requirements, the solution can be adjusted.

## How to run it?

- yarn
- yarn run test

Hope you enjoy it - I did! :)
